Tested on Arduino Nano and custom build timeframe. 
Inspired by https://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA-Frame-Hack-SLOMO-Slow-Motion-Frame/

Additional features:

- 3 independent color channels (RGB) are supported
- adjustment of magnet frequency possible
- frequencies below 60 Hz are possible 
- adjustment of magnet power possible
- adjustment of phase shift led vs mag is possible
- phase shift is adjusted dynamically <- THIS MAKES IT REALLY MORE INTERESTING TO WATCH
